== Description
   This package provides uptime and boot time information, similar to the
   'uptime' Unix command.
    
== Constants
VERSION
   Returns the current version number of this package (as a string).
    
== Class Methods
Uptime.boot_time
   Returns the boot time as a Time object.
    
Uptime.days
   Returns the total number of days the system has been up.
    
Uptime.hours
   Returns the total number of hours the system has been up.
    
Uptime.minutes
   Returns the total number of minutes the system has been up.
    
Uptime.seconds
   Returns the total number of seconds the system has been up.
    
Uptime.dhms
   Calculates and returns the number of days, hours, minutes and
   seconds the system has been running as a four-element Array.
    
Uptime.uptime
   Calculates and returns the number of days, hours, minutes and
   seconds the system has been running as a colon-separated string.
    
== Exceptions
Uptime::Error
   Raised if something goes wrong. On Unix, this would likely mean a
   failure of the times() function. That would be highly unusual.
   
   On Windows, it probably means you failed to connect to WMI properly. The
   mostly likely reason would be that the WMI service wasn't running.
    
== Notes
   On MS Windows each of the class methods optionally takes a host name as
   a single argument. The default is localhost (or whatever the result of
   Socket.gethostname returns).

   The current time, users and load average are NOT included in this
   module, even though you may be used to seeing them with the command
   line version of 'uptime'.  This is because these things have
   _absolutely nothing_ to do with uptime (at least, not as I
   logically think of uptime).
    
   This package was tested successfully on a Solaris system with over 1600
   days of uptime.
    
== Known Bugs
   None that I am aware of.  Please log any bugs you find on the project
   website at http://www.rubyforge.org/projects/sysutils.

   "Doesn't Struct::Tms do this?" - No.
